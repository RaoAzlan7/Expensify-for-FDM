This repo contains the front and backend of the webapp.
Please make sure not to push or merge to the master branch.
when working on your feature create a new branch with your name, and in the read me of the branch add the features you are working on as confirmed in the watsapp.
When you are done with a feature update the chat and make sure it is working on your machine before messaging.

***
<b>Setup
***
To run the webapp on your local machine, first pull all the files, then navigate to backend folder on one terminal and enter this.Then open a new terminal and navigate to the front end and enter the same code below
```
npm i react-scripts
```

***
Run local host
***
Now that you have 2 seperate terminals opened within your editor, in both enter the prompt below to run the local host on your machine.
Once you have both running simply click on the local host link that appears in the terminal (within the front end directory)
```
npm run dev
```

Now if you wish to view the database whilst testing features instead of using api calls message in the chat your email and I can give you access to view changes as you use the APIs.
NOTE: after pullng the branch ensure you have the correct dependencies added.To find the ones removed.
If you ould like to add an additional dependency that will help with your section please specify and update us on the gc before pushing to master and ensure the package.json file in you local branch 
shows all added dependencies.
